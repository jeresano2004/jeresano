            <h1>MALWARE, VIRUS, SPAM, AND ANTIVIRUS</h1>
            <h3>Understanding Malware</h3>
            <img src="media/b4.png" alt="Malware">
            <p><b>Malware</b> refers to software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to devices connected to the internet in order to obtain personal information. Various types of malware include:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Adware</b><br>
                    Displays unwanted advertisements that can harm your device or computer.
                </li>
                <li><b>Spyware</b><br>
                    Monitors your activity stealthily and steals sensitive information like bank account details and personal data.
                </li>
                <li><b>Ransomware</b><br>
                    Blocks users from accessing their systems or data until a ransom is paid. Crypto-malware, a form of ransomware, encrypts files and often demands payment in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, within a specified timeframe.
                </li>
                <li><b>Trojan (or Trojan Horse)</b><br>
                    Disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into downloading harmful programs. Unlike worms, Trojans require a host to operate.
                </li>
                <li><b>Worms</b><br>
                    Stand-alone programs that infiltrate computer networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities. Worms can self-replicate and infect other computers without user action.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Understanding Virus</h3>
            <img src="media/b1.png" alt="Virus">
            <p>A <b>virus</b> is a type of malicious software that can infect devices such as computers, phones, and laptops connected to the internet. Its primary purpose is to compromise personal information, particularly social security numbers, bank account details, and identities. Additionally, viruses can damage your device internally or impersonate you, leading to public humiliation. One major issue related to viruses is blackmail; hackers may use stolen information for extortion. Viruses can gain access to your device through various means, including email attachments, infected websites, or downloads from unknown sources. Warning signs that your device may be infected include slow system performance, random pop-up windows, and unexpected logouts from accounts.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Types Of Viruses:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Direct Action Virus</b><br>
                    Executes its malicious code as soon as a user opens an infected file. Some can remain dormant until a specific action is taken or a predetermined time passes.
                </li>
                <li><b>Polymorphic Virus</b><br>
                    Alters its code to evade detection by antivirus software, making it difficult to identify and remove.
                </li>
                <li><b>File Infector Virus</b><br>
                    Attaches itself to crucial system files necessary for the operating system or major applications. It activates when the system boots up or when the infected program is executed.
                </li>
                <li><b>Multipartite Virus</b><br>
                    Spreads across networks by replicating itself or injecting code into essential computer resources.
                </li>
                <li><b>Macro Virus</b><br>
                    Found in Microsoft Office files, these viruses use macros to download additional malware or execute harmful code when the file is opened.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Understanding Spam</h3>
            <img src="media/b2.png" alt="Spam">
            <p><b>Spam</b> refers to any unsolicited and unwanted form of mass digital communication, typically sent via email, but also through text messages and phone calls. While spam often consists of annoying promotional emails, it can sometimes be a scam aiming to steal personal information.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Antivirus Software</h3>
            <img src="media/b3.png" alt="Antivirus">
            <p><b>Antivirus software</b> is designed to prevent, scan for, detect, and remove viruses from computers. Most antivirus programs operate continuously in the background on various operating systems, ensuring ongoing protection against malware. Comprehensive antivirus solutions protect your files and hardware from threats such as worms, Trojans, and spyware. They often include additional features, such as customizable firewalls and website blocking. Installing antivirus software proactively enhances cybersecurity and protects your system.</p>
