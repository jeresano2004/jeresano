            <br>
            <p><b>Howell Darcy Bohol-Jeresano</b> was born on October 27, 2004, in <b>Sta. Maria, Bulacan</b>. He is the eldest of three children of the Bohol-Jeresano family. A year after his birth, Howell's family decided to move to <b>Sorsogon City</b>, where they joined his grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt, godfather, and godmother. He learned responsibility at a young age after his grandfather suffered a stroke due to excessive drinking. During this challenging time, Howell developed compassion, a love for animals, and the ability to care for his grandfather.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>His father, <b>Dante B. Jeresano</b>, was born in <b>Sorsogon City</b> and is the youngest son of his grandfather's first wife. Dante works as a traffic enforcer in their subdivision. His mother, <b>Mavil B. Jeresano</b>, is a dedicated woman who often sacrifices her time for the betterment of her children. She works a part-time job to provide for the family's future. Mavil is known for her unwavering responsibility and resilience, always supporting her children through thick and thin.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>From an early age, Howell understood the significance of caring for his grandfather. He routinely helped him with daily activities, such as bathing, washing clothes, and organizing medications. Howell's life has also been enriched by family travels, which included beach trips, visiting his mother's relatives, and memorable family outings with his uncle, aunt, godfather, godmother, and cousins. One of the highlights of his life is the time he spends with his immediate family—his father, mother, and two younger sisters—celebrating his birthday with strolls at the pier or park.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>When it came time for school, Howell was enrolled at <b>Tugos Elementary School(TES)</b>. In the second grade, he switched schools to <b>Sorsogon Pilot Elementary School (SPES)</b>, where he studied until the sixth grade. Initially, he was placed in a lower section due to his lack of seriousness about school and difficulty socializing in a new environment. In sixth grade, he was forced to change sections from section 10, where he felt comfortable, to section 6, which contributed to his declining grades due to the unfamiliar and uneasy atmosphere.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>After graduating from SPES, his parents enrolled him at <b>Sorsogon National High School (SNHS)</b>, where he continued to struggle with his academic performance. During senior high school, he joined the <b>Senior High Department</b> at <b>Sorsogon College of Criminology, Inc.(SHS-SCCI)</b>. However, when the pandemic began, Howell became withdrawn, not engaging with classmates or participating in school events. This changed gradually as the pandemic eased and face-to-face classes resumed.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Howell began to transform his attitude toward education in college at <b>Sorsogon College of Criminology (SCCI)</b>, taking his studies seriously. He recognized the importance of higher education, the expense of tuition, and the need to succeed for the sake of his parents and siblings. Now a second-year college student, Howell is doing his best to maintain at least passing grades despite the stress, knowing that his sacrifices will benefit his siblings’ education and support his family in the future. His goal was not just to graduate but to pave the way for his younger sisters, hoping to serve as a role model for them and inspire them to pursue their dreams.</p>
